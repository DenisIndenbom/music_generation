# Music generation

This is my school project on big data for the 10th grade

The goal of the project is to create a neural network for music generation.

The dataset I am using is [GiantMIDI-Piano](https://github.com/bytedance/GiantMIDI-Piano).

Generated music by:
- [RNN](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/best_generated/RNN)
- [VAE](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/best_generated/VAE)
- [GAN](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/best_generated/GAN)
