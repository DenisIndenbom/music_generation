# Music generation

This is my school project on big data for the 10th grade

The goal of the project is to create a neural network for music generation.

The dataset I am using is [GiantMIDI-Piano](https://github.com/bytedance/GiantMIDI-Piano).

Generated music:

[RNN](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/assets/RNN-generated.mp3)
[VAE](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/assets/VAE-generated.mp3)
[GAN](https://github.com/DenisIndenbom/music_generation/raw/master/assets/GAN-generated.mp3)
